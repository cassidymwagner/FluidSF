# Overview
FluidSF is a Python package for calculating structure functions from fluid data. These structure functions can be used to estimate turbulence cascade rates without the constraints of spectral methods. This package serves as a useful tool for analyzing turbulent dynamics in the ocean.

**For detailed documentation and examples, see the [FluidSF website](https://cassidymwagner.github.io/fluidsf).**
