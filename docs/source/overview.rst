Overview of Oceans SF
======================

oceans_sf is a Python package for calculating structure functions from oceanographic data. 
These structure functions can be used to estimate turbulence cascade rates without the constraints 
of spectral methods. This package serves as a useful tool for analyzing turbulent dynamics in the ocean.
